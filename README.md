# How to build
JSorolla is developed in JavaScript 6 (es6) and makes a heavy usage of all the new features. It uses [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) as building tool.

Stable releases are merged and tagged at **_master_** branch, you are encourage to use latest stable release for production. Current active development is carried out at **_develop_** branch, only building is guaranteed to work and bugs are expected, use this branch for development or for testing new functionalities.

### Prerequisites
The following technologies are needed to build JSorolla: [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and its package manager [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/).

##### Installing Node.js and npm

After installing _Node.js_ and _npm_ we have to install all _npm_ dependencies of JSorolla, from the the root folder execute:

```bash
npm install
```
This will make _npm_ to search all dependencies at file [package.json](package.json) and install them locally.

### Develop

After executed the command `npm install` , if you want to run the app just execute the next command:

```bash
npm run serve
```
It automatically open the web app
### Build

You can build all JSorolla _demos_ by executing:

```bash
npm run build
```
when completed, all demos will be located under the `build` folder.

Finally, you can build JSorolla libs by executing:

```bash
npm run dist
```

when completed, all compiled files will be located under the `dist` folder.


# Test
We use [Cypress.io](https://www.cypress.io/) as testing framework.

Having the project running through the command `npm run serve`, you can run the interactive E2E test suite by running the command
```
npm run e2e
```

## Run tests and generate a report
To run test in headless version (no browser) and generate a report, run
```
npm run e2e-report
```
for more help, try ```npm run e2e-report -h```.

For Windows environment, just add the suffix `-win`
```
npm run e2e-win
npm run e2e-report-win
```
for more help, try ```npm run e2e-report-win -h```.

The HTML report will be generated in `./report`. The filename will have the structure `<OPENCGA_STUDY_FQN>__<TIME>_<DATE>.html`
